# Notepad
I created a Nodepad using Java Swing. It was fun to make each and every function that Notepad has from Scratch. Right from its Menu Bar, text area, scroll Bar etc. to adding each and every menu like File, Edit, Format, Color.
Just like our PC's notepad this Notepad can also open text files. make changes, undo and redo them, change the fonts, and font Size. It also has the background color feature.
